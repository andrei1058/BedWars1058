1. No refunds
You can test the plug-in, read the documentation and then you can choose to buy it. "I'm not satisfied" or any excuses like this are baseless. Users which do refunds are banned from spigotmc.org.

2. No redistribution
You are not permitted to redistribute my plug-in in any form, reverse engine or including as a part of any software package. Copyright infringement it's a crime.

3. One purchase is valid for one server
One purchase is valid for one Minecraft server or multiple Minecraft servers connected at the same Bungee network.

4. Unlimited time support
Buyers get unlimited time support on my (the author) Discord server for the plug-in they've bought. This is only guaranteed for english, romanian and italian speakers having manners and a good attitude.
