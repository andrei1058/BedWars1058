# Contributing to BedWars1058
üëç First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to BedWars1058. 
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free 
to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### What should I know before I get started?
#### BedWars1058 and its structure

![Structure](.github/assets/contributing/structure.png)  
We have a module for the public API called `bedwars-api` where we expose 
some parts of the mini-game. The magic happens in the `bedwars-plugin`
module and the others starting by `versionsupport_` are used to handle specific
version-based code. Since BedWars1058 has multi-version support and it does not
rely on Reflection we need to create a new module for each new MC version.
`versionsupport_common` defines what needs to be handled differently 
by each MC version support.

## How Can I Contribute?
#### Reporting Bugs

When you are [creating a bug report](https://github.com/andrei1058/BedWars1058/issues/new), please include as many details as possible.
Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
